# diethack

Diet problem solver with dietary reference intakes in mind.
For more information please see the [homepage](http://www.diethack.org).

## Installation

There's a [package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python2-diethack)
for Arch Linux.
Feel free to use it as a reference when building for your target platform.

You also might find useful a Dockerized
[reproducible build environment](https://github.com/diethack/www)
for the project [homepage](http://www.diethack.org).

## Running the Examples

The following command will generate example diet reports
as seen on the [homepage](http://www.diethack.org):
```
python2 /usr/share/python2-diethack/examples/olegusdiet/runme.py
```

Feel free to play with it. When computing your own diet, it's a good idea
to start with this example and then gradually change it one step at a time
to make sure the diet still computes.

Have fun!
